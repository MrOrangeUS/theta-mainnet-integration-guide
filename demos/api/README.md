### Theta API demo

This demo demonstrates how to interact with the Theta Ledger through the RPC API interface.

To run the demo, first follow the steps in the setup guide to [launch a local private net](https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-mainnet-integration-guide/blob/master/docs/setup.md#setup). Then, import the project under `theta-api-demo` with Intellij, and use Maven to install the dependencies. Then, we can run the demo in the Intellij IDE, it should execute the API calls and print out the API responses.
