This demo demonstrates how to interact with the Theta Ledger through the RPC API interface.

To run the demo, first follow the steps in the setup guide to [launch a local private net](https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-mainnet-integration-guide/blob/master/docs/setup.md#setup). 

# JAVA
Then, import the project under `theta-api-demo` with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and use Maven to install the dependencies. 

# NodeJS
Or, import the project under `javascript-nodejs-demo` with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and use NPM or YARN to install the dependencies. 

Then, we can run the demo in the VS Code IDE, it should execute the API calls and print out the API responses.
